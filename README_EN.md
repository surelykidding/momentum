# Momentum - A Psychology-Driven Focus Application

A self-control training tool based on the Chained Time-Delay Protocol (CTDP) theory, designed to help users build powerful habit chains through the "Sacred Seat Principle," the "Principle of Precedent," and the "Linear Time-Delay Principle."

## 🎯 Core Concept

Momentum is based on the Chained Time-Delay Protocol (CTDP) theory proposed by Edmond on Zhihu, which uses a mathematical model to solve self-control problems:

$$I = \int_{0}^{\infty} V(\tau) \cdot W(\tau) d\tau$$


Where:
- `V(τ)` is the future value function
- `W(τ)` is the weight discount function

## 🔬 The Three Core Principles

### 1. Sacred Seat Principle
By designating a specific trigger action (e.g., "put on noise-canceling headphones," "sit down at the study desk"), you create a "sacred seat." Once this action is triggered, you must complete the focus task in your best possible state. Each time you successfully complete the task, the chain record grows (#1 → #2 → #3...), forming a powerful psychological constraint.

### 2. Principle of Precedent
When faced with a potential rule violation, you have only two choices:
- **Rule as Failure**: The chain is reset to zero and you start over from #1.
- **Rule as Permitted**: The behavior is permanently added to the exception rules and must be allowed in all future instances.

This "case law" mechanism prevents the broken windows effect, allowing the rule boundaries to converge to their most rational state.

### 3. Linear Time-Delay Principle
This principle overcomes the difficulty of getting started by using a "pre-commitment chain":
- Set a pre-commitment signal (e.g., "snap your fingers").
- After giving the signal, you must start the main task within a specified time.
- This utilizes a time delay to lower the initial resistance to starting the task.

## 📖 User Guide

### Create Your First Chain

1. Click "Create Your First Chain" or "New Chain."
2. Set a name for the chain (e.g., "Learn Python").
3. Choose a "Sacred Seat" trigger action (e.g., "Put on noise-canceling headphones").
4. Set the task duration.
5. Configure the pre-commitment chain settings:
   - Pre-commitment signal (e.g., "Snap fingers").
   - Pre-commitment duration (e.g., 15 minutes).
   - Pre-commitment completion condition (usually the same as the main chain's trigger).

### Using the Pre-commitment Feature

1. Click "Pre-commit" on the task card.
2. Perform the pre-commitment signal (e.g., snap your fingers).
3. Fulfill the pre-commitment condition within the specified time.
4. You will automatically enter focus mode.

### Starting a Task Directly

1. Click "Start Task."
2. Perform the "Sacred Seat" trigger action.
3. Enter the full-screen focus mode.

4. Stay focused for the set duration.

### Handling Interruptions

When you need to interrupt a task:
1. Click "Interrupt/Rule Adjudication."
2. Describe the specific behavior.
3. Choose how to handle it:
   - **Rule as Failure**: Resets the chain to zero.
   - **Rule as Permitted**: Adds the behavior to the exception rules.
